The following things are outlined in this workflow:

1. Preparation of genome names for easy parsing
2. Protein calling with prokka
3. Protein annotation using a variety of different databases such as KOs, arCOGs, TIGRs, ...
4. Combination of the output in one large table.

The complete workflow is outlined in Annotations.md.
